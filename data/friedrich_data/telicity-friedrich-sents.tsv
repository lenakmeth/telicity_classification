It is by now well documented that the CIA tolerated crack sales in US cities to fund the operation of South American " contras " It is equally well known that the so-called " war on drugs " begun under the Nixon administration is a failure which has cost hundreds of billions and made America the world leader in prison population ( both in relative and absolute numbers ) .	53	0
