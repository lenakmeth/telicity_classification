Not surprisingly , much of the criticism of Moore 's film is misguided or outright wrong , often vastly more inaccurate than Moore 's work itself .	11	0
Moore portrays the NRA as an unethical , dishonest organization ; he sees the paranoia and fear in the United States as a primary cause of violence , and he does not see gun ownership itself as a problem .	32	0

All in all , it is an accurate portrayal of America 's gun and violence culture .	5	0
On your webpage , you state that " Moore 's resolution is questionable .	11	0

After all , early in the movie he discards the possibility that playing violent video games and watching violent flicks can cause violence -- because Canadians like , and Japanese positively love , those .	26	0
This is a faulty generalization .	1	0
If , as Moore implies ( although never states as fact ) , video games and violent movies are relatively harmless , it does not logically follow that all types of media presentation are harmless .	18	0
There is a huge difference , for example , between playing a game like " Quake " and listening to a radio broadcast that tells you that your family will be killed unless you take action to kill others now .	1	0
The latter is the kind of media propaganda that was used to unleash a genocide in Rwanda in 1994 , which killed 800 ,000 people .	2	0
Similarly , the main motivation for the crusades ( beyond the promise of wealth ) was that Christians were supposedly being slaughtered and had to be saved .	15	0
Moore 's hypothesis ( which apparently comes at least in part from the book " Culture of Fear " by Barry Glassner , also advertised on Moore 's website ) is that the constant bombardment with messages of fear can incite paranoia , which itself can lead to violent acts .	6	0

It is no surprise , however , that US ( and European ) media do not question their own propaganda of fear .	1	0

Of course , critics have conveniently ignored the fact that Lockheed Martin does supply weapons of mass destruction to the US military , and that the company is the nation 's largest military contractor .	27	0
As Moore correctly points out , it is bizarre for a society to openly embrace the production of destructive weapons , but on the other hand see no connection of this to everyday violence -- children learn by imitating adults .	7	0
It is typical for his critics to jump on what is at most a slightly misleading implication , but in doing so , they themselves have , unlike Moore , made many incorrect claims .	1	0

First , the " from my cold , dead hands " part : This is used by Moore as a visual citation to introduce Heston .	14	0
It is perhaps one of his most famous quotes , shown on national TV even here in Germany .	1	0

Nowhere does Moore say or imply that these words were uttered at the rally in Denver , and in fact , their reptition later in the movie at another occasion ( oddly claimed by critics to be again " misattributed " ) is simply a reminder of this .	42	0
It is Moore 's way to say : Viewers , meet Charlton Heston , gun nut extraordinaire .	1	0

Regarding the NRA website excerpt about the case and the highlighting of the phrase " 48 hours after Kayla Rolland is pronounced dead " : This is one valid criticism , but far from the deliberate distortion you make it out to be ; rather , it is an example for how the facts can sometimes be easy to miss with Moore 's fast pace editing .	20	0
The reason the sentence is highlighted is not to deceive the viewer into believing that Heston hurried to Flint to immediately hold a rally there ( as will become quite obvious ) , but simply to highlight the first mention of the name " Kayla Rolland " in the text , which is in this paragraph .	4	0
Unfortunately , because the zooming is rather fast , it is easy to miss the rest of the sentence , so as you correctly note , some viewers got an incorrect impression .	5	0
It would have been fair for Moore to point out this possible misinterpretation on his website .	3	0
However , the claim of deliberate distortion is ludicrous for several reasons : a ) Moore clearly states that " before he came to Flint " , Heston gave an interview .	7	0
In the excerpt from said interview , we can see that it is from March .	12	0

After the Flint rally comes a brief TV interview with Heston , where he is asked about Kayla Rolland ( again , clear evidence that the local media in Flint raised questions about the NRA 's presence ) , then an inteview with country prosecutor Arthur Busch , entirely ignored by critics of the film , who also mentions Heston 's presence as notable , and refers to the immediate reactions of " people from all over America " , gun owners/groups who , according to him , reacted aggressively to warnings of having guns accessible to children , much like spanking advocates react aggressively when anti-spankers point to a case of a child being killed or severely injured by a beating .	14	0
These people do not feel the need to express sympathy , or to think about ways to avoid such incidents , but they feel the need to assert their " rights " and to look for quick , simple answers -- as Busch states , gun owners wanted to " hang [the child] from the highest tree " .	13	0

Immediately after the workers left the building , US steel representatives told the localunion leaders that they had changed their minds and were no longer interested in allowing the workers to purchase themill .	22	0

As he did , his neck stretched in a strange way and I noticed several thin lines , like wrinkles , running across the sides of his neck .	21	0
Nathan ,” he began in the way that people speak when they start a long and difficult explanation , Rachel met someone last night whom it is best never to meet .	26	0
This person , like me , is not a member of traditional society .	6	0
You see , Nathan , there is …separate from your society …oh , damn it .	1	0

We drove between slummy housing and storefronts so decayed that I could n't tell whether they were abandoned .	17	0
My driver turned again next to an old warehouse that I might have been in once when Mitch took us to a rave in sophomore year .	13	0
In front of a few houses , there were cars parked , but there were almost none on the streets .	8	0
Their bumpers looked ready to drop off , and their paint was half smog .	11	0

Hey ,” I said , are you sure that we should be going this way ?	5	0
I mean – ”Just ignore that ,” he told me .	1	0
I noticed that there were some people on the street , people the same color as the soiled buildings .	4	0
Someone standing just in the lip of an alley glared at me with gleaming eyes .	1	0
Glancing back at that gleaming glare , I decided that it might be safer to follow the driver than to wait with the car .	12	0
The ceiling was high and wooden , and I could see part of a DJs booth down the hall .	2	0
It looked like we were in the back of a nightclub .	1	0

I …I noticed him from across the room when I was looking around for Rachel .	10	0
He was standing right in front of some blue lights , so I could n't see him very well , but I noticed the way that the light set off his pale skin .	2	0
It almost looked like the light bent around him without actually touching him directly .	2	0
He was slim , almost drawn , but he had a kind of … luster to him , I guess .	19	0

I remember that he hardly ever moved , just stared at Rachel .	1	0
I dont know how he couldve been heard over the music .”The two glanced at each other .	2	0
What do you think ?” asked the hunchback .	3	0
Ive looked into it a little , and I do think we might be dealing with one of them .	10	0
Have you seen anyone like that in your club ?”Not that I can remember , man .	13	0
I can send you to a guy who knows all about them , though .	8	0
If this cats for real , I bet my friend can tell you everything you need to know .”Youre a wonder , Dvorov .	15	0
It wont be long before nightfall .”Oh yeah , man .	2	0
I owe you one .	1	0
Lets go .” That last one was to me .	6	0
He gave me a half-hearted wave that made me wonder what exactly we were chasing , and whether I should be wearing body armor .	21	0
I saw people with skin stretched so tightly across their cheekbones that the corners had broken through – people whose cheekbones had horns growing from them , and people whose skin was gathered back like a ponytail .	14	0

A corpulent , batrachian woman walked along with something on a leash that looked like a massive water beetle .	13	0

We , and thousands like us , have been living separately as long as there has been a human society ,” said my driver .	9	0
I noticed that the wrinkles on his neck expanded as he breathed and realized that they were gills .	16	0
We interact with humans , take advantage of them , grant them boons , sometimes even become their friends , but the majority of both societies have little or no interaction .	26	0
At this point , we have removed ourselves so fully from quotidian human existence that we are understood to be fictional .	5	0

Those of us who live permanently in this world tend to set up in places like this , where the human population is so overwhelming that they wont be noticed in the right corner , with the right protective spells .”He took out the hunchbacks directions and glanced at an alley behind us .	22	0

I started wondering again how reliable my guides credentials were .	9	0
Walking through an alley with rubbish piles that occasionally skittered from one wall to the other , he did not inspire confidence .	20	0
Just at this corner ,” he said , interrupting my immanent panic attack , were going to stop and turn three times widdersh – er , counterclockwise , then face east .	15	0

Okay , you might feel silly , but just turn three times to your left .	4	0

The door took us to the bottom of a flight of wooden stairs .	2	0
At the top was one door .	3	0
The room held a bed , a bookcase , and a desk with one chair .	2	0
Its only light came from a dying candle on the desk whose spark etched shadows in the roughly planked walls .	3	0
On the bed was a small , ratty man .	3	0
Frankly , I dont know if we can even doing anything against a vampire .	4	0
Theres an entire industry in my world based around how unkillable they are .	12	0

Theyre almost as rare here , and Ive never heard a reliable story of someone successfully fighting a vampire .”Only unsuccessfully , right ?”No , those people dont usually leave stories .”Oh , thanks , Nepthys , for your confidence-inspiring tales of experience .	1	0
Now can you tell me what your master plan of attack will be before we go spinning counterclockwise into an Anne Rice novel ?”My plan is that you shut up while were trying to conduct business with someone who might be able to tell us what were actually going up against .	25	0

It would be a great help to us .”The little man drew a few loud breaths that died in the wooden rooms tight air .	2	0

He told Nepthys the name of a woman who lived on a certain street , and we set off .	9	0
When we reached the street , I expected some sort of temple , or a row of antiquaries , or at least a sleazy , black-market relics merchant .	7	0

The next room had mosaics of what could have been Rome , with men in simple tunics working in a vineyard on one wall and men in odd , floppy hats on the other .	3	0
After this , we went up a flight of stairs and past a row of doors barred on the outside .	16	0
Excuse me ,” I said , ignoring Nepthys warning look , but may I ask what is kept in these rooms ?”The woman laughed .	17	0
This is a slave shop ,” he explained quietly .	1	0
The woman paused before another door , this one not barred but locked .	10	0
As she brought out the key , she said , We deal mostly in fairly mundane trades , but there are a few customers with more unusual needs and people willing to sell unusual items .	20	0
Weve had genies , indentured sorcerers , even golems and the occasional elf .	1	0
This is one of the stranger items , though .	1	0
